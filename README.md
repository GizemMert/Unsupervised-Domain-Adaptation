# Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation
Deep Learning course project. 
The Adaptiope dataset is used with the 20 choosen categories from the product and real_world domains. The choosen categories are included in target_classes variable.
In image classification, different "domains" refer to different styles or textures of images. When a neural network is trained on a specific domain of images, known as the "source domain", it may perform poorly when tested on a different domain of images, known as the "target domain", due to a phenomenon called domain shift.
In domain adaptation, the goal is to ensure that the network cannot differentiate between the distributions of training and test domain examples.
